### 1. **Polarization** in the heart

**Polarization** is a resting state of the heart cells. Here’s a simple way to understand it:

* **Heart cells (cardiac muscle cells)** have electrical charges across their membranes, like a battery with a positive and a negative side.
* When the heart is **at rest**, the inside of the heart cells is **more negative** compared to the outside. This is called **polarization**.

Think of it like a charged battery. It’s **ready** but not doing anything yet.

**Example**: When your heart isn’t actively pumping blood, the cells are in a **polarized** state, and the heart is in **diastole** (relaxed phase).

### 2. **Depolarization** in the heart

**Depolarization** is the process where the heart cells **become active** and start to contract.

* In **depolarization**, the heart cells change their electrical charge so that the inside of the cells becomes **less negative** (more positive), making them ready to contract.

This process creates an electrical signal that spreads through the heart and makes it beat!

**Example**: When the **SA node (sinoatrial node)** in the heart sends an electrical signal, it causes **depolarization**, which is like flipping the switch to **turn on** the heart’s contractions. The **atria** (top chambers) contract first, pushing blood into the ventricles (bottom chambers).

### 3. **Contraction** in the heart

**Contraction** happens after **depolarization**.

* When the heart cells are depolarized, the **muscle fibers** contract. This contraction pushes the blood out of the heart and into the arteries.

There are two main contractions:

* **Atrial contraction**: The atria contract to push blood into the ventricles.
* **Ventricular contraction**: The ventricles contract to push blood out to the lungs and the rest of the body.

**Example**: After the atria contract, the ventricles contract (in response to depolarization), pumping blood to the lungs (right ventricle) or the rest of the body (left ventricle).

### **What happens in ECG?**

An **ECG** is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart. It gives us a graphical representation of the heart’s electrical events, like **depolarization** and **repolarization**.

#### The ECG waves:

* **P-wave**: This represents the **depolarization** of the **atria** (the top chambers).
* **QRS complex**: This represents the **depolarization** of the **ventricles** (the bottom chambers) and is the part of the heart that contracts to pump blood out.
* **T-wave**: This represents the **repolarization** of the **ventricles** (resetting the cells to be ready for the next contraction).

### Putting it All Together

Let’s walk through a cycle of the heart using these concepts:

1. **Polarization** (Resting phase): All heart cells are at rest. The inside of the cells is negative, like a battery that’s ready.

2. **Depolarization** (Activation phase):

   * The **SA node** triggers depolarization, causing the atria to contract (shown by the **P-wave** on an ECG).
   * Then, the signal travels to the ventricles, causing the **QRS complex** on the ECG, and the ventricles contract to pump blood.

3. **Contraction**: The heart pumps blood, and after contraction, the heart cells need to **reset**.

4. **Repolarization**: The cells return to their resting state (negative inside), shown as the **T-wave** on an ECG.

### Quick Summary:

* **Polarization**: Heart cells are at rest, ready to work.
* **Depolarization**: Heart cells become activated and contract.
* **Contraction**: The heart muscle contracts, pumping blood.
* **ECG**: Measures electrical signals of polarization, depolarization, and repolarization.
