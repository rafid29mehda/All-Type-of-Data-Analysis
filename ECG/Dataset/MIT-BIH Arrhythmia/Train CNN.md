To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the preprocessed MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for classifying ECG beats as normal (0) or abnormal (1), we’ll build on the preprocessed dataset (`mitdb_beats.npy` and `mitdb_labels.npy`) created in the previous steps. This guide provides a **step-by-step process** to train a CNN in Google Colab, with detailed explanations for each step, assuming no prior knowledge. I’ll explain every detail, including what each line of code does, what to do next, and how to run the code in Colab cells. The code will be provided in `<xaiArtifact/>` tags, and no `.py` files will be created, as requested.

We’ll use the preprocessed dataset (beats of 201 samples each, labeled as 0 or 1), split it into training and testing sets, address class imbalance, build a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras, train the model, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model. Each step will include a code block, an explanation, and instructions for what to do next.

### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**
**What**: Install and import the Python libraries needed for training the CNN.
**Why**: We need TensorFlow for building and training the CNN, scikit-learn for data splitting, and other libraries for data handling and visualization.
**How**: Run a code cell in Colab to install libraries and import them.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Colab Notebook**: You’re in a Colab notebook with cells. Each cell runs code or displays text. Run cells by clicking the play button (▶) or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
- **Libraries**:
  - `tensorflow`: For building and training the CNN.
  - `scikit-learn`: For splitting data and handling class imbalance.
  - `numpy`, `matplotlib`: For data handling and plotting.
- **`pip install`**: Installs libraries not pre-installed in Colab.
- **Imports**: Load the libraries into the Python environment.
- **Running the Code**: The code below installs and imports the libraries.

```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install tensorflow scikit-learn

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import resample
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

# Print TensorFlow version to confirm installation
print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}")
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `!pip install tensorflow scikit-learn`: Installs TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

- Add a new code cell (click “+ Code”).
- Copy and paste the code above.
- Run the cell (▶ or `Shift + Enter`). It takes a few seconds.
- Check the output. It should show the TensorFlow version (e.g., “TensorFlow Version: 2.17.0”).
- If there are errors (e.g., “Failed to fetch”), check your internet connection and re-run.
- Once successful, move to Step 2.

---

### **Step 2: Load the Preprocessed Dataset**
**What**: Load the preprocessed beats and labels from Google Drive.
**Why**: The dataset (`mitdb_beats.npy`, `mitdb_labels.npy`) contains the segmented ECG beats and their labels, which we need for training.
**How**: Mount Google Drive and use `numpy` to load the `.npy` files.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Google Drive**: The preprocessed files are in your Drive’s root folder (from the previous preprocessing steps).
- **Mounting Drive**: Authenticate with your Google account to access Drive.
- **Dataset**:
  - `mitdb_beats.npy`: Shape `(n_beats, 201)`, each row is a 201-sample beat.
  - `mitdb_labels.npy`: Shape `(n_beats,)`, each element is 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal).
- **Running the Code**: The code below mounts Drive, loads the files, and prints their shapes.

```python
# Import Google Drive
from google.colab import drive

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Load the preprocessed dataset
beats = np.load('/content/drive/My Drive/mitdb_beats.npy')
labels = np.load('/content/drive/My Drive/mitdb_labels.npy')

# Print shapes and label distribution
print(f"Beats Shape: {beats.shape}")
print(f"Labels Shape: {labels.shape}")
print(f"Normal Beats: {np.sum(labels == 0)}")
print(f"Abnormal Beats: {np.sum(labels == 1)}")
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `from google.colab import drive`: Loads Drive tools.
- `drive.mount('/content/drive')`: Prompts you to authenticate and mount Drive.
- `import numpy as np`: For loading `.npy` files.
- `beats = np.load(...)`: Loads the beats array.
- `labels = np.load(...)`: Loads the labels array.
- `print(...)`: Shows the shapes and number of normal/abnormal beats.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell. Follow the authentication link, copy the code, and paste it into Colab.
- Check the output, e.g.:
  ```
  Beats Shape: (100000, 201)
  Labels Shape: (100000,)
  Normal Beats: 90000
  Abnormal Beats: 10000
  ```
- If the files load correctly, move to Step 3. If you get a “File not found” error, ensure `mitdb_beats.npy` and `mitdb_labels.npy` are in your Drive’s root folder.

---

### **Step 3: Prepare the Data**
**What**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and handle class imbalance.
**Why**: We need separate data for training and testing to evaluate the model. The dataset is imbalanced (more normal beats), which can bias the model.
**How**: Use `train_test_split` to split the data and `resample` to balance the training set.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Train/Test Split**: Use 80% of the data for training, 20% for testing.
- **Class Imbalance**: Normal beats (~90%) dominate abnormal beats (~10%). We’ll oversample the abnormal class in the training set to balance it.
- **Reshaping**: The CNN expects input shape `(samples, 201, 1)` (201 samples, 1 channel).
- **Running the Code**: The code below splits the data, balances the training set, and reshapes the arrays.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import resample
import numpy as np

# Split the data into train and test sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    beats, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=labels
)

# Print shapes before balancing
print(f"Original Training Set: Normal={np.sum(y_train == 0)}, Abnormal={np.sum(y_train == 1)}")

# Balance the training set by oversampling the abnormal class
# Separate normal and abnormal beats
normal_idx = np.where(y_train == 0)[0]
abnormal_idx = np.where(y_train == 1)[0]
X_train_normal = X_train[normal_idx]
y_train_normal = y_train[normal_idx]
X_train_abnormal = X_train[abnormal_idx]
y_train_abnormal = y_train[abnormal_idx]

# Oversample the abnormal class to match the normal class
X_train_abnormal_resampled, y_train_abnormal_resampled = resample(
    X_train_abnormal, y_train_abnormal,
    n_samples=len(X_train_normal), random_state=42
)

# Combine the balanced training set
X_train_balanced = np.concatenate([X_train_normal, X_train_abnormal_resampled])
y_train_balanced = np.concatenate([y_train_normal, y_train_abnormal_resampled])

# Shuffle the balanced training set
shuffle_idx = np.random.permutation(len(X_train_balanced))
X_train_balanced = X_train_balanced[shuffle_idx]
y_train_balanced = y_train_balanced[shuffle_idx]

# Reshape data for CNN (samples, 201, 1)
X_train_balanced = X_train_balanced.reshape(-1, 201, 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 201, 1)

# Print shapes and label distribution after balancing
print(f"Balanced Training Set: Normal={np.sum(y_train_balanced == 0)}, Abnormal={np.sum(y_train_balanced == 1)}")
print(f"Test Set: Normal={np.sum(y_test == 0)}, Abnormal={np.sum(y_test == 1)}")
print(f"X_train_balanced Shape: {X_train_balanced.shape}")
print(f"X_test Shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: For splitting data.
- `from sklearn.utils import resample`: For oversampling.
- `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...)`: Splits data, with `stratify=labels` to maintain class proportions.
- `normal_idx = np.where(y_train == 0)[0]`: Finds indices of normal beats.
- `X_train_normal = X_train[normal_idx]`: Extracts normal beats.
- `X_train_abnormal_resampled, ... = resample(...)`: Oversamples abnormal beats to match normal count.
- `X_train_balanced = np.concatenate(...)`: Combines normal and resampled abnormal beats.
- `shuffle_idx = np.random.permutation(...)`: Shuffles the training set.
- `X_train_balanced = X_train_balanced.reshape(-1, 201, 1)`: Adds a channel dimension for the CNN.
- Prints shapes and distributions.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell. You should see output like:
  ```
  Original Training Set: Normal=72000, Abnormal=8000
  Balanced Training Set: Normal=72000, Abnormal=72000
  Test Set: Normal=18000, Abnormal=2000
  X_train_balanced Shape: (144000, 201, 1)
  X_test Shape: (20000, 201, 1)
  ```
- If the shapes are correct, move to Step 4. If there’s an error, ensure Step 2 loaded the data correctly.

---

### **Step 4: Build the CNN Model**
**What**: Define a CNN architecture for classifying ECG beats.
**Why**: CNNs are effective for time-series data like ECGs, capturing patterns in the signal.
**How**: Use Keras to create a 1D CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **CNN Architecture**:
  - **Conv1D Layers**: Extract features from the 201-sample beats.
  - **MaxPooling1D**: Reduces dimensionality.
  - **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting.
  - **Dense Layers**: Make the final classification (normal vs. abnormal).
- **Parameters**:
  - Input shape: `(201, 1)` (201 samples, 1 channel).
  - Output: 1 unit with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Running the Code**: The code below builds and summarizes the CNN.

```python
# Import Keras libraries
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Build the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(201, 1)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=5, activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print model summary
model.summary()
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`: For building the model.
- `model = Sequential([...])`: Defines the CNN layers:
  - `Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=5, ...)`: 32 filters, 5-sample window.
  - `MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)`: Halves the feature map size.
  - `Flatten()`: Converts 2D features to 1D.
  - `Dense(128, ...)`: Fully connected layer.
  - `Dropout(0.5)`: Drops 50% of units to prevent overfitting.
  - `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`: Outputs probability (0 to 1).
- `model.compile(...)`: Sets the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
- `model.summary()`: Shows the model’s layers and parameters.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell. You should see a summary like:
  ```
  Model: "sequential"
  _________________________________________________________________
  Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
  =================================================================
  conv1d (Conv1D)              (None, 197, 32)           192
  max_pooling1d (MaxPooling1D) (None, 98, 32)            0
  ...
  dense_1 (Dense)              (None, 1)                 129
  =================================================================
  Total params: 123,521
  ```
- If the summary appears, move to Step 5. If there’s an error, ensure TensorFlow is installed (Step 1).

---

### **Step 5: Train the Model**
**What**: Train the CNN on the balanced training set.
**Why**: Training adjusts the model’s weights to classify beats accurately.
**How**: Use the `fit` method to train for several epochs, with validation data.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Epochs**: Number of times the model sees the training data (e.g., 10).
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples per training step (e.g., 32).
- **Validation Split**: Use 20% of the training data to monitor performance.
- **Running the Code**: The code below trains the model and plots the training history.

```python
# Import matplotlib for plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced,
    epochs=10,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=1
)

# Plot training and validation accuracy
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Plot training and validation loss
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `history = model.fit(...)`: Trains the model:
  - `epochs=10`: Trains for 10 passes.
  - `batch_size=32`: Processes 32 samples at a time.
  - `validation_split=0.2`: Uses 20% of training data for validation.
  - `verbose=1`: Shows a progress bar.
- Plotting shows how accuracy and loss change over epochs.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell. Training takes 5–10 minutes (depending on Colab’s GPU).
- You should see:
  - A progress bar for each epoch, showing accuracy and loss.
  - Two plots: one for accuracy, one for loss, comparing training and validation.
- If training completes, move to Step 6. If it crashes (e.g., “Out of memory”), reduce the training set size in Step 3 (e.g., resample to 50,000 normal beats).

---

### **Step 6: Evaluate the Model**
**What**: Test the model on the test set and analyze its performance.
**Why**: We need to know how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
**How**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
  - **Precision/Recall**: Measures performance on normal and abnormal classes.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true vs. predicted labels.
- **Running the Code**: The code below evaluates the model and visualizes results.

```python
# Import libraries
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Predict on test set
y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype(int)

# Print classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Normal', 'Abnormal']))

# Compute and plot confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Normal', 'Abnormal'], yticklabels=['Normal', 'Abnormal'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.show()
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype(int)`: Predicts labels (threshold at 0.5).
- `print(classification_report(...))`: Shows precision, recall, and F1-score.
- `cm = confusion_matrix(...)`: Computes the confusion matrix.
- `sns.heatmap(...)`: Plots the matrix.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell. You should see:
  - A classification report, e.g.:
    ```
    Classification Report:
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support
    Normal       0.95      0.98      0.96     18000
    Abnormal     0.85      0.70      0.77      2000
    ```
  - A confusion matrix plot showing true vs. predicted labels.
- If the results appear, move to Step 7. If there’s an error, ensure Step 5 completed.

---

### **Step 7: Save the Model**
**What**: Save the trained CNN model to Google Drive.
**Why**: Saving allows you to reuse the model without retraining.
**How**: Use Keras to save the model and copy it to Drive.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Model Format**: Save as an HDF5 file (`.h5`), which stores the model’s architecture, weights, and optimizer state.
- **Google Drive**: Copy the file to Drive for permanent storage.
- **Running the Code**: The code below saves the model.

```python
# Import shutil for file copying
import shutil

# Save the model
model.save('ecg_cnn_model.h5')

# Copy to Google Drive
shutil.copy('ecg_cnn_model.h5', '/content/drive/My Drive/ecg_cnn_model.h5')

print("Model saved to Google Drive!")
```

**What Each Line Does**:
- `import shutil`: For copying files.
- `model.save('ecg_cnn_model.h5')`: Saves the model locally.
- `shutil.copy(...)`: Copies to Drive.
- `print(...)`: Confirms success.

**What to Do Next**:
- Add a new code cell.
- Copy and paste the code.
- Run the cell.
- Check your Google Drive for `ecg_cnn_model.h5`.
- The model is ready for future use.

---

### **Final Notes**
- **Dataset**: The preprocessed data (`mitdb_beats.npy`, `mitdb_labels.npy`) was used to train a CNN for binary classification.
- **Model Performance**: Expect ~95% accuracy, with better performance on normal beats due to their prevalence. Improve by:
  - Adding more layers or filters.
  - Using techniques like data augmentation.
  - Adjusting the class imbalance strategy.
- **Using the Model**: Load with `tf.keras.models.load_model('ecg_cnn_model.h5')` for predictions.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - **Memory Issues**: Reduce the training set size in Step 3.
  - **Poor Performance**: Increase epochs or tweak the model architecture.
  - **File Errors**: Ensure Drive is mounted and files are in the correct location.
- **Next Steps**: Use the model for predictions or fine-tune it. Ask if you need code for this!

This guide provides a complete pipeline to train a CNN on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database in Google Colab. Each step is modular and beginner-friendly.
